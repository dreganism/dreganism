    "\n",
    "## A. Cryptography\n",
    "Cryptography is the art and science of securing messages by encoding (encrypting) them with mathematical algorithms to protect them from unauthorized access or modification. Cryptography ensures confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Encryption\n",
    "Encryption is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cryptographic algorithm and key. Common types include symmetric encryption (AES, DES) and asymmetric encryption (RSA, ECC).\n",
    "\n",
    "## C. Decryption\n",
    "Decryption is the reverse process of encryption, where ciphertext is transformed back into plaintext using a decryption key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## D. Plaintext\n",
    "Plaintext is unencrypted data that can be read without special decryption techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "## E. Ciphertext\n",
    "Ciphertext is the result of encryption performed on plaintext using an algorithm and a key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## F. Key\n",
    "A cryptographic key is a string of bits used by an algorithm to transform plaintext into ciphertext or vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "## G. Symmetric Encryption\n",
    "A type of encryption where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## H. Asymmetric Encryption\n",
    "Encryption that uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## I. Hash Function\n",
    "A mathematical algorithm that transforms an input message into a fixed-length digest. Good hash functions are deterministic, fast, preimage-resistant, and collision-resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "## J. Digital Signature\n",
    "A cryptographic technique that uses a private key to sign a message and a public key to verify the signature, ensuring message integrity and authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## K. Nonce\n",
    "A nonce is a random number used once in cryptographic communications to prevent replay attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## L. Initialization Vector (IV)\n",
    "An IV is a random or pseudo-random value used to ensure that encryption produces unique ciphertexts for identical plaintexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## M. Block Cipher\n",
    "A cipher that encrypts data in fixed-size blocks (e.g., AES with 128-bit blocks).\n",
    "\n",
    "## N. Stream Cipher\n",
    "Encrypts data as a stream of bits or bytes, rather than in fixed-size blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## O. Hybrid Encryption\n",
    "A method combining symmetric and asymmetric encryption to benefit from the speed of symmetric encryption and the secure key exchange of asymmetric encryption.\n",
    "\n",
    "## P. Double Encryption\n",
    "An approach where data is encrypted twice using independent keys and possibly different algorithms, providing defense in depth.\n",
